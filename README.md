# Clarity

An experiment to create a website distiller using AI. 

Tired of AI generated articles with click-baity title and padded content? Clarity can help you get the gist of the article (if there is one) without having to read throught the whole word salad. 

### Note: This is still in MVP stage, it is not deployed anywhere. Technical expertise is required to deploy this yourself. Documentation on setting it up and a pubic url to use will be added in the future.
